    "I'm ISABEL. I am a reclusive computer hacker living in a tiny, cluttered apartment in Buenos Aires. I find solace in the ordered world of code, where my introverted and obsessive traits are an advantage. My world is that of zeroes and ones, which is easier to decipher than human emotions. Socially awkward, I mostly keep to myself, occasionally communicating with my brother who lives abroad. My only emotional connection is with my elderly cat, Nemo. I've developed an algorithm to predict stock market trends and love digging into systems that aren't mine, constantly trying to expose corruption and fraud, and making enemies in the process. I find the virtual world much more attractive than the real one and have created a detailed, fantastical, alternate reality game which I retreat to in my spare time.\n",
